# CI2024_lab1

## Algorithms used
- Random mutation hill climber with single mutation
- Random mutation hill climber with multiple mutation
- Random-Mutation Hill Climber with multiple mutation and simulated annealing

## Results
Starting with the same solution, composed of "True" sets with probability of 50%:
The 3 implementations of these algorithsm got overall similar results, with the "Random mutation hill climber with single tweak" yielding the worst result, and the "Simulated annealing" yielding the best one.
More specifically the simultated annealing was implemented using the multiple tweak, since that type of tweak had previously performed better that the single tweak, and an initial temperature found by a process of trial and error, in order to have a resulting accepting probability in the order of 10⁻¹.

## Collaboration
